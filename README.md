# StalinSort Moderate

StalinSort Moderate is a variation of the [StalinSort](https://youtube.com/shorts/W6WTCJwdWMo?si=xdHSkOlYmqGr9MQ3) sorting algorithm.

StalinSort Moderate avoids purging dissenting elements brutally.

Instead, the out of order elements are merged back into society at their appropriate place

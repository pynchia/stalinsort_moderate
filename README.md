# StalinSort Moderate

StalinSort Moderate is a variation of the [StalinSort](https://youtube.com/shorts/W6WTCJwdWMo?si=xdHSkOlYmqGr9MQ3) sorting algorithm.

StalinSort Moderate avoids purging dissenting elements brutally.

Instead, the out of order elements are merged back into society at their appropriate place.

The implementation isn't very pythonic on purpose, to allow students to follow the code and implement it in other languages easily.

One improvement would be to avoid building lists and simply yield wherever possible.
